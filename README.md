# Plotly Challenge

This dashboard displays operational taxonomic units (OTU) data for microbes that grow in people's belly buttons.

## Start Here
A GitHub Pages site has been set up for this project [here](https://jakemperry.github.io/plotly-challenge/).

The page will load with data for the first Test Subject ID.  Data displays include: 
- Test subject demographic data (blue card)
- Top 10 OTU present in test subject's navel. (horizontal bar chart)
- A gauge that shows the number of times per week the test subject washes their navel (gauge)
- All OTU present in the test subject's navel (bubble chart)

Hover your cursor over different bars or bubbles on the charts to see the names/labels of the OTUs.

A dropdown menu is provided which will show Test Subject ID Numbers for all test subjects in the dataset.  Click the dropdown menu to select a new test subject ID number.  Once the number is selected, all graphs, gauges, and demographic data will update to reflect relevant information to that test subject ID number.
